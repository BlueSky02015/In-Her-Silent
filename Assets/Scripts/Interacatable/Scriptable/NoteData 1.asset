  content: "I miss him. Every single day. My Henry\u2014his laugh, the way he\u2019d
    hum off-key while making tea, even the way he\u2019d snore like a bear in winter.
    Fifty years together, and then\u2026 silence. The house is too big without him.
    Too quiet.\r\n\r\nI tried everything to move on. Prayers, grief groups, even
    those silly self-help books. But nothing filled the hole he left. Then, one night,
    I found it\u2014an old leather-bound book in the back of Henry\u2019s shelf.
    \"Whispers Beyond the Veil.\" Dark, crumbling pages filled with rituals, promises\u2026
    \na way to bring him back...\r"
