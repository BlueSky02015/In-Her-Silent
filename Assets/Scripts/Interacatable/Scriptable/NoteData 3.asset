  title: Regret
  content: "Now, my love, I\u2019m trapped. The house won\u2019t let me go. I watch
    you from the shadows like a spirit I just wanted to see him one last time. Now,
    I\u2019ll never leave.\r\n\r\nIf you feel a chill when no window\u2019s open\u2026
    if the lights flicker when you say his name\u2026 it\u2019s me. I\u2019m sorry.
    Don\u2019t make my mistake. Some doors shouldn\u2019t be opened.\r\n\r\nLove
    always,\r\nGrandma ......"
